Q => Create an ec2 instance like t3.micro in mumbai region in zone Ap-south-1-a and configure webserver and make it live and attach 5gb ebs volume and create 10 files like devops.txt

Create a instance in aws

set hostname

yum install httpd -y

rmpquery httpd

cd /var/www/html

cat > index.html

cd

systemctl start httpd

systemctl enable httpd

allow port 80 in inbound rules -> http

copy public ip and paste ip:80
Launch and connect instance

run command - lsblk -> to check storage and partition

GO to elastic block store in aws

volumes - name it to vol1

then create new volume (make sure to create in same availability zone)

Select GP2 - size 5gb

Now go to EBS - volumes

select the new generate volume - action -> attach

select instance hosted name

attach

Go to console

lsblk -fs

blkid

file system command

mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdb --> formats the new disk - a for disk 1 b for disk 2 .. (here for us xvdb will xome as nvme something)

blkid

create a mount point

mkdir /data

mount /dev/xvdb /data/

df -h - to check if storage is mounted

cd /data/

touch Sanjaya.txt{1..100} -> to create 100 files

THIS WAS TEMPORARY MOUNTING for this question this is the end

TO MAKE IT PERMANENT-.

cd

blkid -> copy the uuid of partition b

open

vim /etc/fstab/

paste the uuid - to mount it permanenetly or by name - /dev/xvdb /data ext4 defaults 0 0

it means mount xvdb to data folder using ext4 file system

RESTART THE INSTANCE
