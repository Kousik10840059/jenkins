Q Create a custom Vpc. Where you need to create two subnets like public and private, in public subnet I want to host my web server where my website is running and Private subnet my database is running. Database should not be reachable publicly
Hosting a VPC -

while creating instance allow icmpv4 for all

V - VPC -> cidr 10.0.0.0/16 I - IGW S - Subnet R - Route Table

-Search VPC

-Create VPC

Vpc Setting -> vpc only - no ipv6 cidr -> give range 10.0.0.0/16 -> create
FOR OHIO GIVE - 20.0.0.0/16
Now make IGW(internet gateway)

Name tag - devops-igw -> create

Now go to subnet -:

Create subnet -> -> devops-vpc -> give name -public subnet -> zone us-east-1a -> subnet cidr -> 10.0.0.0/24 -> create subnet

FOR OHIO 20.0.0.0/24

Create another subnet -> private subnet -> us-east-1b -> 10.0.1.0/24-> create

FOR OHIO 20.0.1.0/24

Now launch a instance- select devops-vpc - select public subnet -> enable auto assign public ip->allow port ssh 22 -> script if any -> launch instance

Launch another instance - select devops-vpc ->select private subnet -> subnet cidr -> disable auto assign public ip -> 10.0.1.0/24 -> allow 22 -> launch instance

Go to IGW -> select the igw -> attach to devops-vpc

Go to Route tables -> create -> name it -> select devops vpc -> create -> edit route -> cidr 0.0.0.0/0 and add route internet gateway -> create

edit subnet association -> edit and add public -> save

Go to instance and allow ICMP ipv4 protocol in inbound rules -> save

Connect the public machine in terminal

Copy the content from the key pair in the computer.

GO to the public machine vim devops-host.pem -> and paste the key save exit

chmod 400 devops-host.pem

ssh -i devops-host.pem ec2-user@privateip of private machine

NOW YOU WILL BE CONNECTED TO THE PRIVATE MACHINE

Now to use internet in private machine

For this question Create a server in public 
yum install httpd -y
cd /var/www/html
cat > index.html 
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
allow port 80 and http in instance security group (public)
