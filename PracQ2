copy public ip and paste ip:80
aunch and connect instance

run command - lsblk -> to check storage and partition

GO to elastic block store in aws

volumes - name it to vol1

Select GP2 - size 5gb

Now go to EBS - volumes

select the new generate volume - action -> attach

select instance hosted name

attach

Go to console

lsblk -fs

blkid

file system command

mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdb --> formats the new disk - a for disk 1 b for disk 2 ..

blkid

create a mount point

mkdir /data

mount /dev/xvdb /data/

df -h - to check if storage is mounted

cd /data/

touch Sanjaya.txt{1..100} -> to create 100 files

THIS WAS TEMPORARY MOUNTING
