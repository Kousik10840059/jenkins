Q My company is running e-commerce worload on a webserverr during the sale, servers are going to down so how we can balance the load.

create 4 instances in different zones - same security group

Go to load balancing 

Create Target group

choose instances name it next and add the machines - include in pending create target group

Now go to - Load Balancer Create application load balancer

Name it Internet facing (for databse it should be internal) IPv4

select the zones in which you had made the instances (a,b,c,d)

select the same security group as instance

select http and target group then create target group 
(Then click on your created tg and then in below select register target below add port
Only if the page doest work)

Now go to load balancer

wait for it to get active Now select the load balancer created Scroll and copy the DNS name and paste it on website

Now to check - go on any machine terminal and systemctl stop httpd

Now refresh the webpage and you will see bad gateway - later in the target group amazon will put the machine to unhealthy and stop diverting requests to it

TO ENABLE SESSION STICKINESS

Go to target groups - select your target group Go to actions - edit target group attributes

Target selection configuration - stickiness - turn on - duration 1 - days save changes

Now refresh the webpage the server wont change -
