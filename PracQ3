Q configure a webserver in Mumbai region . I need same server in Singapore 

Create a instance in aws

set hostname

yum install httpd -y

rmpquery httpd

cd /var/www/html

cat > index.html

cd

systemctl start httpd

systemctl enable httpd

allow port 80 in inbound rules -> http

copy public ip and paste ip:80
select the instance

click on actions

image and templates

create a image

go to create image

Keep the reboot instance to unticked

delete on termination - untick

then click on create AMI

Now go to AMI and you will see your AMI created

You can terminate the old instance ( if delete on termination was unticked)

create new instance - select my ami and you will see your ami

select it and go ahead

copy the new ip and paste it on brower ip:80 and you will see the existing file that you created
Go to images - AMIs

select the AMI

Click on actions -> copy AMI

Choose new destination region ex. Ohio

click on copy AMI

and switch to Ohio region from the main menu drop down

Check the AMI image -> and check on status until it becomes available

AMI is a region based service.

Then edit AMI permission

Add account id and paste the AWS account id of the one who you want to share

Then apply

search on private ami and you will find it

Then deploy an instance using that AMI
